## In-Game Visual Debug Mode
### Overview
Currently, when developers or users add or modify features in the game, such as a player or enemy unit, the effects of those changes are not always immediately clear during gameplay. To address this, I plan to implement an in-game visual debugging mode that provides real-time feedback on key unit attributes and interactions.

This feature will include:

- Health bars for units.
- Range indicators for towers and enemies.
- Hitbox visualizations for units.
    
This debugging mode will be controlled by a JSON configuration file. The file will include a boolean to enable or disable the visuals, making it easy for developers to toggle the mode without modifying code directly.
